		<h1>Roar</h1>
		<h2>by Katy Perry</h2>
		<p>I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
	Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
	So I sit quietly
	Agreed politely</p>
		<p>I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing 
So I fell for everything</p>
		<p>You held me down but I got up (HEY!)
Get ready 'cause I’ve had enough
I see it all
I see it now

I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion
And you’re gonna hear me roar

Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion
And you’re gonna hear me roar
You’re gonna hear me roar

Now I’m floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee, I earned my stripes
I went from zero
To my own hero

You held me down but I got up (HEY!)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder gonna shake the ground

You held me down but I got up (HEY!)
Get ready 'cause I’ve had enough
I see it all
I see it now

I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion
And you’re gonna hear me roar

Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion
And you’re gonna hear me roar
You’re gonna hear me roar

Ro-oar, ro-oar, ro-oar, ro-oar, ro-oar

I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion
And you’re gonna hear me roar

Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion
And you’re gonna hear me roar (YEAH!)
You're gonna hear me roar

Ro-oar, ro-oar, ro-oar, ro-oar, ro-oar

You're gonna hear me roar</p>
