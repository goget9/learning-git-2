		<h1>Roar</h1>
		<h2>by Katy Perry</h2>
		<p>I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath<br>
	Scared to rock the boat and make a mess<br>
	So I sit quietly<br>
	Agreed politely</p>
		<p>I guess that I forgot I had a choice<br>
I let you push me past the breaking point<br>
I stood for nothing <br>
So I fell for everything</p>
		<p>You held me down but I got up (HEY!)<br>
Get ready 'cause I’ve had enough<br>
I see it all<br>
I see it now</p>
		<p>I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter<br>
Dancing through the fire<br>
'Cause I am a champion<br>
And you’re gonna hear me roar</p>
		<p>Louder, louder than a lion<br>
'Cause I am a champion<br>
And you’re gonna hear me roar<br>
You’re gonna hear me roar</p>
		<p>Now I’m floating like a butterfly<br>
Stinging like a bee, I earned my stripes<br>
I went from zero<br>
To my own hero</p>
		<p>You held me down but I got up (HEY!)<br>
Already brushing off the dust<br>
You hear my voice, you hear that sound<br>
Like thunder gonna shake the ground</p>
		<p>You held me down but I got up (HEY!)<br>
Get ready 'cause I’ve had enough<br>
I see it all<br>
I see it now</p>
		<p>I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter<br>
Dancing through the fire<br>
'Cause I am a champion<br>
And you’re gonna hear me roar<p>
		<p>Louder, louder than a lion<br>
'Cause I am a champion<br>
And you’re gonna hear me roar<br>
You’re gonna hear me roar</p>
		<p>Ro-oar, ro-oar, ro-oar, ro-oar, ro-oar</p>
		<p>I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter<br>
Dancing through the fire<br>
'Cause I am a champion<br>
And you’re gonna hear me roar</p>
		<p>Louder, louder than a lion<br>
'Cause I am a champion<br>
And you’re gonna hear me roar (YEAH!)<br>
You're gonna hear me roar</p>
		<p>Ro-oar, ro-oar, ro-oar, ro-oar, ro-oar</p>
		<p>You're gonna hear me roar</p>
